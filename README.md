# apprenticeship-2021_10_28-1-task-loops_time

So, this was quite an interesting day. We jumped right in with this clock-like thing that we were tasked to create. IIRC, we had approximately 10 to 20 minutes per task on average. As can be seen with me using switch-case instead of more simple if statements, I did not work well with the time pressure. But I could improvise reasonably well, and, funnily enough, the more we progressed, the easier it got for me because of how I structured my program in the earlier stages. My personal highlight was the last task, which, for me, was just 2 if statements, making me finish first. I gotta say, I was having quite a good time.
